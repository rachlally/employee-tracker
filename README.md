# Employee Tracker
A simple content management system to help any company manage their database

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a useful program for any company.  Large or small, this program will help organizations keep track of departments, roles, salaries, employees, and easily update information within the database. 

I learned how to use mysql, creating and formatting databases.  Within mysql, I also learned how to join tables with foreign keys to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data provided.  I better understand the beauty of using switch statements with large amounts of case options.  The biggest challenge of this assignment proved to be adding data to the tables which was a huge hurdle but fun part of the learning process on this assignment.

You will be provided a list of options to Add to the database: New Department, New Role, or New Employee.  You may also update an exisiting employee's role in the company.  To exit the program, select End Program.
